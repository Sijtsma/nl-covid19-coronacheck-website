title: How long is my test declaration valid?
---
A test declaration is valid for 40 hours after testing, as during that time there's a minimal chance you'll infect others. Make sure you schedule your test on time and have your QR code scanned for access within 40 hours.
 
Good to know: in My Overview you can see how long your QR code is still valid.
