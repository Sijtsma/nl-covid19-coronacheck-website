You don’t have a DigiD, smartphone or computer with a printer? Then you can call the CoronaCheck-phone on <a href="tel:+31702085285">+3170 - 208 52 85</a>. If you call this number, you’ll speak to a voice-response system. There you can ask to have your paper corona certificate sent to your home address. 

For safety reasons, corona certificates can only be sent through post services. The certificates will be delivered to the address you are registered to at the municipality.
