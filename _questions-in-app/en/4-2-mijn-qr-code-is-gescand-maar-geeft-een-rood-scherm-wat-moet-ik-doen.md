A red screen means your certificate or entry pass in the form of a QR code is invalid. So there’s no proof of a vaccination, a positive test result or a recent negative test result. It could also mean your test certificate has expired. Here’s what you can do:

- Always show the QR code using the CoronaCheck app. Or a printed version from [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print). A screenshot or copy of a QR code will always lead to a red screen.
- Check the time on your phone. If the time on your phone is ahead, behind, or set to a different time zone, this may also lead to a red screen
- Completely close the CoronaCheck app. Then launch it again and have your QR code scanned once more
- Keep getting a red screen even though you have a valid certificate or entry pass? Contact the CoronaCheck helpdesk by phoning <a href="tel:08001421">0800-1421</a>

Entry always requires a green screen. So show your valid QR code using the app or the paper version. Don’t have a valid certificate or entry pass? Unfortunately, this means you’re unable to enter.
