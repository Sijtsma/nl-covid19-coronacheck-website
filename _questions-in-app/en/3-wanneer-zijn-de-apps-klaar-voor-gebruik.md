title: When are the apps ready to be used? 
---
From June 5, you will need a negative test result to access some activities and locations. You can turn that into a personal QR code with CoronaCheck. Show the QR code and your ID at the entrance.

From the beginning of July you can also use CoronaCheck to create a personal QR code from your vaccination certificate. You can use this in the Netherlands or for travel to other countries in the European Union.
