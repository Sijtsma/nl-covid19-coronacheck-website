If the app doesn't show a negative test result, there are 2 possible scenarios: 

1. **Your test result has yet to be processed** <br />
   It can take a couple of hours before your test result is processed by the testing location. Try again later. Did you take your test more than a few hours ago? Contact your testing location.

2. **Your test result was positive** <br />
   A positive test result indicates you had corona at the time of testing, which means you can't make a test declaration by means of a QR code. The testing location will get in touch with you.
