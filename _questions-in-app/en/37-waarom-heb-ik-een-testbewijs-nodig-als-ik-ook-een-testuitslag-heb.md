title: Why do I need a test certificate if I already have a test result? 
---
You need a test certificate for two reasons:

- a test certificate has been provided with a digital signature. This signature makes it difficult to change or falsify the result.
- A test certificate is more privacy-friendly than the test result. A test certificate contains much less personal data than the test result, namely only your initials and your date and month of birth.
