title: Can I get access if I have been vaccinated?
---
No, itâ€™s currently not possible to get access with a vaccination certificate. When you have been vaccinated, you still need a negative test result to get access.

End of June, your proof of vaccination will also give you access to events and locations in the Netherlands.

From the beginning of July, you can also use CoronaCheck to create a European QR code from your vaccination certificate. You can use this QR-code to travel to other countries in the European Union. The Dutch QR-code you use in the Netherlands.
