title: Which locations require a test declaration to get access?
---
CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner are currently being tested in <a href='https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/algemene-coronaregels/cijfers-en-onderzoeken-over-het-coronavirus/pilot-toegangsbewijzen' target='_blank' hreflang="nl" rel='noopener noreferrer'>pilots 'Testen voor Toegang' (Dutch)</a>. These pilots prove if the apps are working properly and show how they can be improved.

At this point in time, the CoronaCheck app is being tested in field trials. In the future, access to certain social, cultural and sports locations will require a negative test result: a visit to the museum, festival or football match.
 
The government will determine which locations will require a test declaration, but only after this has been approved by law. Moreover, the test declaration is only a temporary measure enabling short-term access to certain activities in a responsible manner.
