title: Can I use the CoronaCheck app abroad?

At this moment you canâ€™t use the CoronaCheck app abroad.

From the beginning of July, you can also use CoronaCheck to create a European QR code from your vaccination certificate. You can use this QR-code to travel to other countries in the European Union. The Dutch QR-code you use in the Netherlands.
