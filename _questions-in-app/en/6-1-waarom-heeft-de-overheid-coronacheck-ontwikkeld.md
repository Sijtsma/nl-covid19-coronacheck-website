title: Why is the government developing CoronaCheck?
---
The government is working hard to open up society responsibly. Using CoronaCheck, visitors can get access to certain locations or activities. And they can travel again (from the 1st of July). But only if they have been vaccinated, or a test shows they didnâ€™t have coronavirus at the time. 

Using the CoronaCheck app, people in the Netherlands can create a corona certificate. This is possible when you:

- recently tested negative for coronavirus, or;
- have been (fully) vaccinated against coronavirus, or;
- have recovered from a corona infection in the last 6 months (possible from the 1st of July)

The CoronaCheck app can be used within the Netherlands, and for international travel. The app creates two QR codes: an international QR code, and a Dutch QR code. You can show these using the CoronaCheck app, or print them on paper via the website.
