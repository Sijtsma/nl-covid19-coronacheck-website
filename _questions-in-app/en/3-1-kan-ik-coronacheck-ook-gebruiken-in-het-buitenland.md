Yes, you can from July 1. When you make a QR code, you’ll automatically get a QR code for The Netherlands and a QR code for other countries.
 
When you’re abroad, always use the international QR code. Please note: this QR code is meant for travel. You may be asked to show it at the border or in the country of destination. You can also use the international QR code to enter locations in the country you’re visiting. However, you must comply with local regulations to do so.  
 
Want to know which test, recovery and vaccination certificates are valid in the country you’re visiting?Take a look at {{ site.data.links.wijsoprijs[page.lang] }}. This’ll help you avoid any unpleasant surprises once you’re there.
