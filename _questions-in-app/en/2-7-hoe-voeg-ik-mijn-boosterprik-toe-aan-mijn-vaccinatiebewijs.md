For every vaccination, you’ll receive a separate international QR code with the date of the injection. You can read more about this on: [Why do I have a separate international QR code for every vaccination I’ve had? And which one should I use?](/en/faq/3-5-waarom-heb-ik-voor-elke-prik-een-internationale-qr-code/)

<h2 class="h2-question">Have you received two vaccinations and then a booster?</h2>

Your international certificate contains three QR codes with doses registered as ‘1/2’, ‘2/2’ and ‘3/3’.

<h2 class="h2-question">Have you had coronavirus and a vaccination? Or have you received a Janssen vaccination and then a booster?</h2>

Your international certificate contains two QR codes with doses registered as: 1/1 and 2/1. This is to indicate that your primary vaccination series holds one vaccination.
