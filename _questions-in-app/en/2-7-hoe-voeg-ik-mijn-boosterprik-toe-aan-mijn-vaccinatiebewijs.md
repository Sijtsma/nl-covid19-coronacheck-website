title: I received a booster injection, how do I add it to my vaccination certificate?
---
Vaccinations are not retrieved automatically. Therefore, after every injection, you need to retrieve your vaccination details again by logging in with DigiD via the '+' symbol in the top right corner of the app. Did you receive a letter code from the entity that vaccinated you? Then you can add it via ‘add paper certificate’ and create your vaccination record this way.

For every injection, you’ll receive a separate international QR code with the date of the injection. You can read more about this on: [Why do I have a separate international QR code for every vaccination I've had? And which one should I use?](/en/faq/3-5-waarom-heb-ik-voor-elke-prik-een-internationale-qr-code/). 

You will only receive one Dutch QR code with all your vaccination details. This only shows the date from which your complete vaccination certificate is valid. In the Netherlands, you are fully vaccinated after two injections (unless you have received the Janssen vaccine).

Have you been vaccinated abroad, but did you receive your booster injection in the Netherlands? Or were you fully vaccinated abroad? Read more about registering your vaccinations on {{ site.data.links.buitenlandvaccinatie[page.lang] }}
