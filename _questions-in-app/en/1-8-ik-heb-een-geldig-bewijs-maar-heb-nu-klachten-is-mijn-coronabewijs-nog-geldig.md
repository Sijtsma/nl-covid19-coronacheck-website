Are you experiencing symptoms related to coronavirus? Or do you have to quarantine? Then please follow the {{ site.data.links.basisregels[page.lang] }}: stay at home, get tested and avoid contact with others. Even if you have been (fully) vaccinated.

Your coronavirus pass will not be deleted or become invalid if you're experiencing symptoms or have been tested positive. However, because you have to quarantine in this case, you won't be able to use it at this moment.
