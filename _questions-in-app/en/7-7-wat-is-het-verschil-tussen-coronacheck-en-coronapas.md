In the Netherlands, you can use the CoronaCheck app to retrieve your coronavirus entry pass. Download the CoronaCheck-app for free in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

Newspapers and television programmes often mention a 'coronapas' (Dutch for 'coronavirus entry pass'). However, in most of these cases, they're actually referring to CoronaCheck.

**Please note:** you'll also find a 'Coronapas' app in the app stores. This app was developed by the Danish government. So you won't be able to use it to collect your coronavirus entry pass.
