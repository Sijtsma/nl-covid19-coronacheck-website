To enter certain locations or activities, you must first get tested for coronavirus at an <a href="/en/testafspraak-in-app">affiliated test location</a>. You can apply for a test with the organiser of the event or activity. The organiser will know where you can get tested.

Experiencing symptoms that could indicate COVID-19? <a href="/en/testafspraak-in-app">Get tested at the GGD</a>.
