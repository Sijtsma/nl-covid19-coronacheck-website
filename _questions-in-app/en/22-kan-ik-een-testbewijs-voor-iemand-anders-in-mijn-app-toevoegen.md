title: Can I add someone else's test certificate to my CoronaCheck app?
---
At this time, it is not possible to add another person's test certificate to your CoronaCheck app. 

**Note:** when you make a new QR code, your old QR code disappears. The CoronaCheck app only holds 1 person's test certificate. This means every individual visitor needs their own phone and CoronaCheck app, or an individually printed test certificate. You can download and print off your test certificate via [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print).
