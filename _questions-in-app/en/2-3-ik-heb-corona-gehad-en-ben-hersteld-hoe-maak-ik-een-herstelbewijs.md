title: When can I create a recovery certificate?
---
You may use a positive test result to create a recovery certificate with CoronaCheck. A number of rules apply:

- The recovery certificate is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the recovery certificate may be created earlier.
- In the case of a recovery certificate, the positive test result may be a maximum of 180 days old.

**Please note:** It has been agreed in a European context that a recovery certificate may only be issued on the basis of a PCR test. For use within the Netherlands (for example for access to events), a recovery certificate is also issued based on an antigen test. A recovery certificate is never provided on the basis of a self-test or a serological test.

For all rules regarding creating a recovery certificate, please look at the page {{ site.data.links.herstelbewijs[page.lang] }}.
