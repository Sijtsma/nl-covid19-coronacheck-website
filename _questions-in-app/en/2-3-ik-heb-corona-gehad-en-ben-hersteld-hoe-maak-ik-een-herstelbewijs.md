You may use a positive test result to create a recovery certificate with CoronaCheck. A number of rules apply:

- The positive test was carried out by the GGD
- The recovery certificate is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the recovery certificate may be created earlier
- The positive test result is a maximum of 180 days old

If you've had a PCR test, you'll receive a Dutch and international QR code. Have you had an antigen test? Then you'll only receive the QR code necessary for access within the Netherlands. 

This means it isn't possible to create a recovery certificate based on the results of an antibody test.
