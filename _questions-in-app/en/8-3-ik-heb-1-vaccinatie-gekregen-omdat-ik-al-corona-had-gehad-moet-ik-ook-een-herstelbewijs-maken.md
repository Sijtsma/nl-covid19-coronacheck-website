title: I received 1 vaccination because I’ve had coronavirus. Do I have to create a certificate of recovery too?
---

This depends on whether you have indicated to the healthcare provider who carried out the vaccination you only need one vaccination (because you’ve already had coronavirus). And how the health care provider registered this single vaccination as complete. 

## Registered

If the vaccinator has completely registered your single vaccination, you don’t have to create a separate certificate of recovery. You can then create a complete certificate of vaccination. 

## Not registered
Is your single vaccination not completely registered? You can add a certificate of recovery in the app if you have been tested negatively for coronavirus at the GGD in the past 180 days.
