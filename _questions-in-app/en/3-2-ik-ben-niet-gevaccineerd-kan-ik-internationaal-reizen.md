Yes, you can if you carry a negative test result with you. Within Europe, a testing result is accepted as valid proof (the Digital Coronavirus Certificate). Before leaving, please read through the terms on  <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/travelling-outside-the-netherlands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Travelling outside the Netherlands</a>. This way you’re well prepared for your trip.
