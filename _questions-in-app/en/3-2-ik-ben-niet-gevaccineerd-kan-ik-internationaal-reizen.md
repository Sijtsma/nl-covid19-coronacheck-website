title: I haven’t been vaccinated. Can I travel internationally?

Yes, you can if you carry a negative test result with you. Within Europe, a testing result is accepted as valid proof (the Digital Coronavirus Certificate). Before leaving, please read through the terms on  {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }}. This way you’re well-prepared for your trip. 

**Please note:** if you were tested abroad, you cannot create a test certificate using the CoronaCheck app or by going to Coronacheck.nl/print. In this case, please create your test certificate in a way that applies to the country you're in.
