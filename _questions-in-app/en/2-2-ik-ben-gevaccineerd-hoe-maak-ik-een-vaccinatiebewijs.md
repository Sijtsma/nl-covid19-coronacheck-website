At this moment, it's not possible to create a Dutch vaccination certificate, because vaccination certificates are currently not in use within the Netherlands.

You can create an international vaccination certificate. You get this certificate already after only one vaccination. An international vaccination certificate is valid for 270 days after the completion of full vaccination. Once you’ve received a new (booster)vaccination, you can add it yourself by logging in again with DigiD. A decision about the validity of booster vaccinations has not been made yet. For children up to 18 years old, a full vaccination certificate is valid indefinitely. This does not require a booster vaccination. Please note: the validity of a certificate made after one vaccination depends on the rules of the country you’re visiting. Check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} to see which rules apply at your destination.

For all rules regarding creating a vaccination certificate, please look at the page {{ site.data.links.vaccinatiebewijs[page.lang] }}.
