Want to retrieve your vaccination details in the app? [Read here how to retrieve your vaccination details](/en/faq-in-app/1-1-hoe-werkt-de-coronacheck-app). 

## Retrieve your full vaccination
To create a Dutch QR code, you need to be fully vaccinated. Your certificate is only valid 14 days after you've been fully vaccinated. An international QR code can be created after one vaccination. Please note: a QR code made after one vaccination is not valid in every country. Therefore please check the travel advice on {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }}.

## Are you having problems and were you vaccinated in the Netherlands?

Are you having one of the following problems:

- Name and/or date of birth incorrect?
- Are both vaccinations registered on the same day?
- Or are you not able to fully retrieve your vaccination details, while your last vaccination was over three days ago?

Then your vaccination details might not have been registered the right way. Please contact your vaccination provider  (GGD op {{ site.data.translations.phone-ggd[page.lang] }}, hospital, general practitioner or another healthcare provider.

## Were you vaccinated abroad?
Unfortunately you cannot use CoronaCheck yet to create a vaccination certificate. In some countries you can create a coronavirus pass while you were over there that is valid in the Netherlands too. You can read more about this on {{ site.data.translations.coronabewijs-hulp-link[page.lang] }}.
