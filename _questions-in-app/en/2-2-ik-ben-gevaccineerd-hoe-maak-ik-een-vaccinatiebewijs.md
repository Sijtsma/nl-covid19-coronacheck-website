For a Dutch vaccination certificate, you need to be fully vaccinated. A vaccination certificate is valid for 270 days after the completion of full vaccination. A decision about the validity of booster vaccinations has not been made yet. For children up to 18 years old, a full vaccination certificate is valid indefinitely. This does not require a booster injection. You only need one injection to make an international QR code.

**Please note:** the validity of a certificate made after one vaccination depends on the rules of the country youâ€™re visiting. Check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} to see which rules apply at your destination. 

For all rules regarding creating a vaccination certificate, please look at the page {{ site.data.links.vaccinatiebewijs[page.lang] }}.
