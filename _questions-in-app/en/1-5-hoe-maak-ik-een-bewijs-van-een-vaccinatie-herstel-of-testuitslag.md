If you’ve recently tested negative, if you’ve had corona or if you’ve been vaccinated, you can make a certificate or entry pass (in the form of a QR code) to gain entry to a location. You can create the QR code via the app or [via the website](/en/print). The steps are clearly indicated. 

**Please note:** a vaccination certificate becomes valid 14 days after you’re fully vaccinated.
 
The [CoronaCheck Scanner](/en/scanner) app never shows whether your certificate or entry pass was made from a positive/negative test result or a vaccination. This is because vaccinations aren’t mandatory in the Netherlands.

Abroad, however, it could matter what your certificate or entry pass was made from. This is because countries individually determine which type(s) of certificate they accept. They also set their own terms – like the validity of a test, for example. Before you travel, always go to {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }} to check the terms of the country you’re visiting. The Netherlands is committed to ensuring the terms within Europe are as equivalent as possible.
