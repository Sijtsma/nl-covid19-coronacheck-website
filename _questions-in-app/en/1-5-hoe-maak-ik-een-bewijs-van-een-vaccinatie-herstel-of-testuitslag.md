If you’ve recently tested negative or you’ve been vaccinated, you can make a certificate or entry pass (in the form of a QR code) to gain entry to a location. You can create the QR code via the app or [via the website](/en/print). The steps are clearly indicated. 
 
The [CoronaCheck Scanner](/en/scanner) app never shows whether your certificate or entry pass was made from a test result or a vaccination. This is because vaccinations aren’t mandatory in the Netherlands.

Abroad, however, it could matter what your certificate or entry pass was made from. This is because countries individually determine which type(s) of certificate they accept. They also set their own terms – like the validity of a test, for example. Before you travel, always go to <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/travelling-outside-the-netherlands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Travelling outside the Netherlands</a> to check the terms of the country you’re visiting. The Netherlands is committed to ensuring the terms within Europe are as equivalent as possible.
