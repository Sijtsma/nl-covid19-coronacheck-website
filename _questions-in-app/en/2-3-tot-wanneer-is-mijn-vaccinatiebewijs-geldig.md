We’re unsure at this point. How long immunity from a vaccination lasts is still being researched. When we know how long you’re protected by a vaccination, its validity will be updated based on that information. Until then, the proof of vaccination is valid indefinitely.
 
Good to know: in ‘my overview’ in the CoronaCheck app, you can check how long the QR code is still valid for. But please note: you can only check the validity of the Dutch QR code.

Tip: have you printed a coronavirus entry pass? Make sure to print a new one each month. For privacy reasons, it’s good to regularly print entry passes.
