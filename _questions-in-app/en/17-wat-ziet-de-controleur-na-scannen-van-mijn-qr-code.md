title: What does the scanner see after scanning my QR code?
---
When scanning your QR code, the scanner only gets a green screen (for a valid test declaration) or a red screen (for an invalid test declaration).

The QR code includes your identifying data. The scanner checks if these are in correspondence with your proof of identity.

A red screen does not mean you have coronavirus. It only means the test declaration is not valid.
