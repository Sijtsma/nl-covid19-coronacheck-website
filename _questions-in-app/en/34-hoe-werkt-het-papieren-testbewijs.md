title: How does the printed test certificate work?
---
Don't own a smartphone or prefer a printed test certificate? Go to  [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) and follow these steps: 

1. Enter the token that was sent along with your negative test result.
2. CoronaCheck verifies your code and retrieves your test result
3. Your negative test result is converted into a test certificate in the form of  a QR code
4. Print off your QR code 

You have your QR code scanned at the entrance of the location you want to access. Is the QR code valid and does your identifying data correspond with your proof of identity? Then you're allowed access.
