The CoronaCheck app is currently only used for the pilots 'Testen voor Toegang'. To get access to these events or activities, you first have to take a corona test at a specific test location. You can sign up with the host of the event or activity. They will know how you can get a (free) test. The test appointments for pilot events are booked via [www.testenvoortoegang.nl](www.testenvoortoegang.nl).

Please note: a negative test result from the GGD currently does <u>not</u> generate a test declaration in the CoronaCheck app. This also applies to other commercial test providers.
