title: I want to get tested, where should I go?
--- 
To access certain locations or activities, you must first take a coronavirus test at an official test location. You can apply for a test with the organiser of the event or activity. They will know how you can take a (free) test. 

Please note: if you have a negative test result issued by the GGD, you currently cannot use the CoronaCheck app to turn it into a test certificate. This also applies to other commercial testing parties.
