When you’re visiting a country that requires proof, you can just use the Coronacheck app. When asked, please show the international QR code. Stick to Covid-restrictions imposed by the country you’re travelling through. Check <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/travelling-outside-the-netherlands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Travelling outside the Netherlands</a> to verify if you can use CoronaCheck to gain access to certain locations.
