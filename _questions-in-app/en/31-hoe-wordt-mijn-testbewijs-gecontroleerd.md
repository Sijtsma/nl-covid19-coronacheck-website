Your test declaration is checked with the CoronaCheck Scanner app. This app is developed by the government. The CoronaCheck Scanner app checks the validity of your test declaration at the entrance by scanning the QR code.

When you have a valid test declaration, the scanner is presented with a green display. In addition, they check if the identifying data on the green display is in correspondence with your proof of identity.
