Suffering from symptoms such as a cold, cough or shortness of breath? Stay at home. This also applies if you’re vaccinated.

If you were tested negative but have symptoms now, you need to get tested again at GGD. A negative test result means that you did not have corona at the time of testing. It’s possible you may have got infected later.
