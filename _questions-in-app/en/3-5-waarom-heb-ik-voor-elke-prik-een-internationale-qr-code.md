From now on, you get an international QR code for every vaccination youâ€™ve had in the CoronaCheck app and on [coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print/) This can be useful for people who want to go to a place where their latest vaccination is not yet valid.

## Which QR-code should I use?

Which QR code you have to show depends on the demands of the country you're visiting. Before leaving, please always check which certificate you need at your destination at {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }}.
