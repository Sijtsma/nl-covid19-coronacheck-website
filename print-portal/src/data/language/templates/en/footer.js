                CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner have been developed by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and
                Sport. Both the apps and the test declaration on paper would not have been possible without the support
                of dozens of specialists, hands-on experts and a large open-source community of citizens. They all
                lent a hand and helped to test the app during its development.
