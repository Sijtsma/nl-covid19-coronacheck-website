Yes, you can. You can download the APK-file via this link:

<a href="/files/apk/nl.rijksoverheid.ctr.verifier/latest.apk" class="btn btn--cta" download>Download APK file</a>

Note: CoronaCheck Scanner is being updated on a regular basis. Sometimes this is a mandatory update. In that case, CoronaCheck Scanner will no longer work until the new version is installed. The app will notify you and refer you to the store. Did you install the Scanner manually via the APK file? Then you also have to manually update the app when you receive this notification. Advice: use CoronaCheck Scanner from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as much as possible.
