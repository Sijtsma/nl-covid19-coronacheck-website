title: I’m organising an event without WiFi. Will I be able to scan visitors’ QR codes?

Yes, you’ll be able to. The CoronaCheck app and the CoronaCheck Scanner can both be used offline. The CoronaCheck app and CoronaCheck Scanner app need to connect to the internet once every 24 hours to stay up to date, but they don’t have to connect in the meantime.
