The Dutch government wants to open certain locations and activities in a responsible manner in times of corona. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors access to these locations, though only if they have a valid corona virus entry pass.

With CoronaCheck Scanner, the scanner checks the validity of the visitorâ€™s coronavirus pass at the entrance. CoronaCheck Scanner is only meant for usage within the Netherlands.
