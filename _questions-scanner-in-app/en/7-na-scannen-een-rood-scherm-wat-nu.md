title: I get a red screen after scanning a QR code. What now?
---
A red screen means the visitor’s QR code is not valid. This does not mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means they don’t have a certificate of vaccination or a recent negative test certificate in their app, or the certificate has expired (older than 40 hours).  

- Check if the visitor has used a screenshot instead of the QR code directly from the app. Scanning a screenshot will lead to a red screen.
- Check whether the visitor shows a Dutch QR code. An international QR code results in a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to restart the app. And try scanning again. 
- Keep getting a red screen while the visitor has a vaccination or negative test result? Please refer them to our helpdesk at <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>

At all times, a green screen is required for access. Does the visitor not have a (valid) QR code? Then they’re not allowed access.
