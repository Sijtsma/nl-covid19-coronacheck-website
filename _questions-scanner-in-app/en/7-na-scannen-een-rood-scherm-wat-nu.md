title: I get a red screen after scanning a QR code. What now?
---
A red screen means the visitor’s QR code is not valid. This does not mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means the scanned QR code is not valid. This means they have either shared a screenshot, they don’t have a recent negative test certificate in their app or the test declaration has expired (older than 40 hours).  

- Check if the visitor has used a screenshot instead of the QR code directly from the app. Scanning a screenshot will result in a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to restart the app. And try scanning again. 
- Check the time on the visitor's phone. If the time on the visitor's phone is incorrect, it will result in a red screen. 
- Keep getting a red screen while the visitor has a negative test result? Please refer them to our helpdesk at <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>

At all times, a green screen is required for access. Does the visitor not have a (valid) QR code? Then they’re not allowed access.
