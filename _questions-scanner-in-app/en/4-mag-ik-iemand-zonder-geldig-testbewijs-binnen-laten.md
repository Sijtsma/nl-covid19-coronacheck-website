No, at all times the visitor must be able to show a valid test declaration and proof of identity.  A test declaration is also required during the pilots ‘Testen voor Toegang’.  

You can check the validity of a test declaration with the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Green screen? That means the visitor’s test declaration is valid. You can now check if the identifying data on the green screen match the details on their proof of identity. All good? Then they’re allowed access. They may also need an additional entrance ticket.
