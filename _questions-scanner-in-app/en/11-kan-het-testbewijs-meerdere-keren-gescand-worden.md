title: Can the certificate be scanned multiple times?
---
Yes, thatâ€™s possible. A certificate is valid for 40 hours after the time of testing. Within this time frame, the test certificate (QR code) can be scanned multiple times. A QR code created from a vaccination is valid for longer and can be scanned multiple times too.
