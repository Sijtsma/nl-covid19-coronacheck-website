title: How can I inform my employees about the CoronaCheck app?
---
In the Toolkit for organisers, you'll not only find information for your employees, but also information you can share beforehand with visitors to your location or event. Download the toolkit with communication materials here: {{ site.data.translations.wetransfer-toolkit-link[page.lang] }} (via We Transfer).

Information about the practical workings of the app can be found on [TODO Zo werkt scannen](/en/scanner/zo-werkt-scannen). Here you can also [try scanning beforehand](/en/scanner/uitproberen).
