CoronaCheck Scanner works on all iOS and Android phones with Android 6 and iOS 12 and up (iPhone 5s and newer). You also need a working phone camera. 

You donâ€™t need an internet connection to scan for access at the entrance. You do need an internet connection once every three days minimum to sync the configuration of the app.
