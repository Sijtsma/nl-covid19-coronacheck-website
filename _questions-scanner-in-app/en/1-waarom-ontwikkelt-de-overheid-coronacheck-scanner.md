title: Why is the government developing CoronaCheck Scanner?
---
The Dutch government wants to open certain locations and activities in a responsible manner in times of corona. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors access to these locations, though only if they can prove they are vaccinated, they’ve had corona or did not have corona at the time of testing.
 
With CoronaCheck Scanner, the scanner checks the validity of the visitor’s coronavirus pass at the entrance. CoronaCheck Scanner is only meant for usage within the Netherlands.
