title: For which locations do visitors need a test declaration to get access?
---
The CoronaCheck app is currently only tested during pilots for ‘Testen voor Toegang’. For an overview of events requiring a test declaration, see the <a href='https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/algemene-coronaregels/cijfers-en-onderzoeken-over-het-coronavirus/pilot-toegangsbewijzen' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>website of the Dutch Government (Dutch)</a>.

In the future, access to certain social, cultural or sports events will require a negative test result. Such as a visit to a museum, festival or football match. 

The government will determine which locations should require a test declaration, but only after the legal bills have been passed. The test declaration is only a temporary means to help us reopen certain events in a safe and responsible manner.
