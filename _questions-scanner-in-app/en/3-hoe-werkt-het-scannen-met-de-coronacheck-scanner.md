title: How does CoronaCheck Scanner work?
---
## 1. Keep distance

Press 'Start Scan’ and ask the visitor to display their certificate, either from the CoronaCheck app or printed off as a hard copy. The certificate, in the form of a QR code, can be scanned from a safe distance. 

## 2. Scan the QR code

Aim your phone camera at the visitor’s certificate and scan the QR code.

## 3. Green screen

Green screen? The visitor has a valid certificate. Check if the identifying data on the green screen corresponds with the details on the proof of identity. In order to protect the visitor’s privacy, not all data is displayed. Some fields may contain a hyphen (-). It’s sufficient to check the details that are displayed. If the details are incorrect, the visitor is not allowed access.

All good? Then the visitor is allowed access. They may need an additional entrance ticket. 

## 4. Red screen
A red screen does **not** mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means the QR code is not valid. This means there is no proof of a vaccination, a recovery or recent negative test result, or the test certificate has expired (older than 24 hours). In this case:

- Check if the visitor has used a screenshot instead of the QR code directly from the app. Scanning a screenshot will lead to a red screen.
- Check whether the visitor shows a Dutch QR code. An international QR code results in a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to restart the app. And try scanning again. 
- Keep getting a red screen while the visitor does have a vaccination or a positive / negative test result? Please refer the visitor to our helpdesk at <a href="tel:08001421">0800-1421</a>.

At all times, a green screen is required for access. If the visitor doesn’t have a (valid) QR code, you can’t give them access. For more information, visit [www.coronacheck.nl/scanner](/en/scanner).
