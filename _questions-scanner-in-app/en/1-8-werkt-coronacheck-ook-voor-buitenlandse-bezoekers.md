title: Does CoronaCheck also work for foreign visitors?
---
Visitors from another European country can use the EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC). Using a paper or digital DCC from their country of origin, they can be allowed access to Dutch events. To do so, they have to create a vaccination, recovery or test certificate. Organisers can scan every EU DCC using the Dutch CoronaCheck Scanner app. 

Foreign visitors can also download the CoronaCheck app, but they don’t have to. Visitors from countries that don’t use the EU DCC need to get tested beforehand through Testen voor Toegang and convert their result in CoronaCheck into a coronavirus pass.
