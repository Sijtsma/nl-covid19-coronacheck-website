title: Where can I get tested?
--- 
The CoronaCheck app is currently only used for the pilots 'Testen voor Toegang'. To get access to these events or activities, you first have to take a corona test at a specific test location. You can sign up with the host of the event or activity. They will know how you can get a (free) test. The test appointments for pilot events are booked via <a href="https://www.testenvoortoegang.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" hreflang="nl">testenvoortoegang.nl</a>.

Please note: a negative test result from the GGD currently does <u>not</u> generate a test certificate in the CoronaCheck app. This also applies to other commercial test providers.
