title: Where can I get tested?
--- 
To access some locations or activities, you must first take a corona test at a test location. You can register with the organizer of the event or activity. The organizer knows how you can get tested (for free).

Please note: a negative test result from the GGD currently does <u>not</u> generate a test certificate in the CoronaCheck app. This also applies to other commercial test providers.
