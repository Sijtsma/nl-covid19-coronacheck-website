title: Which countries can I visit with an international QR code?
---


You’re able to travel with a proof of vaccination or a negative test result (in the form of a QR code). Before you go, have a look at <a href="https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/reizen-naar-het-buitenland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" hreflang="nl">this overview (Dutch)</a>. There, you’ll learn whether a QR code is valid in the country you’re visiting. You can also use the international QR code to enter locations in the country you’re visiting. However, you must comply with local regulations to do so.  
 
From early July, you’re also able to make a certificate if you’ve had coronavirus and recovered from it (recovery certificate).
