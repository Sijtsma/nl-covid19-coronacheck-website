title: Why is the government developing the CoronaCheck app?
---
The government is working hard to open public venues in a responsible manner. The pilots ‘Testen voor Toegang’ are part of this. Access testing plays a key role and allows opening of social, cultural and sports locations faster yet responsibly.
 
The CoronaCheck app allows people access to these locations, but only if a corona test proves they did not have corona at the time of testing. In the app, the valid negative test result generates a test declaration by means of a QR code. This serves as your test declaration. Don’t own a smartphone? You can print off your test declaration as a hard copy via [www.coronacheck.nl/print](https://www.coronacheck.nl/print).
