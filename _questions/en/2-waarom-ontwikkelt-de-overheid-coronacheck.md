title: Why is the government developing the CoronaCheck app?
---
The Dutch government wants to open social, cultural and sports locations in a responsible manner in times of corona. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors access to these locations, though only if a corona test shows they did not have corona at the time of testing.

In the app, the valid negative test result generates a test certificate by means of a QR code. This serves as your test certificate. Donâ€™t own a smartphone? You can print off your test certificate as a hard copy via [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](https://www.coronacheck.nl/en/print).
