title: The app doesn't show a negative test result. Why?
---
If the app doesn't show a negative test result, there are 2 possible scenarios:

## Your test result has yet to be processed

It can take a couple of hours before your test result is processed by the testing location. Try again later. Did you take your test more than a few hours ago? Contact your testing location.

## Your test result was positive

A positive test result indicates you had corona at the time of testing, which means you canâ€™t make a test certificate by means of a QR code. The testing location will get in touch with you.
