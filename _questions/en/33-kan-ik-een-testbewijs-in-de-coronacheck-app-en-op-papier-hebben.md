title: Can I have both a digital test certificate in the CoronaCheck app and a printed test certificate?
---
You can, but you don’t have to. Your test certificate (QR code) is valid for 40 hours and can be scanned multiple times within that time frame. If for whatever reason you can’t load your test certificate in the app, you can still print your test certificate via [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print).

**Note:** the CoronaCheck app only holds 1 person’s test certificate. This means every individual visitor needs their own phone and CoronaCheck app, or an individually printed test certificate.
