title: Can I have both a digital test declaration in the CoronaCheck app and a printed test declaration?
---
You can, but you don’t have to. Your test declaration (QR code) is valid for 40 hours and can be scanned multiple times within that time frame. If for whatever reason you can’t load your test declaration in the app, you can still print your test declaration via [www.coronacheck.nl/print](/print).

**Note:** the CoronaCheck app only holds 1 person’s test declaration. This means every individual visitor needs their own phone and CoronaCheck app, or an individually printed test declaration.
