If you are visiting, please get vaccinated or tested on coronavirus first. Have you been vaccinated, or does the test show that you don’t have coronavirus? Then you will be able to gain access to locations and activities. You can retrieve your vaccination or test result using the app. Here is how this works:   

1. Get your vaccination or test details using DigiD or using the retrieval code the test location provided to you.
2. After checking, the CoronaCheck app will retrieve your vaccination or test result
3. The app will turn your vaccination or negative test results into proof in the form of a 
QR code.

**Please note:** from the beginning of July you can also create proof you’ve had coronavirus and have since recovered (a statement of recovery). You can do this as well following the above steps.

Have your QR code scanned for access, or at the border. Is your QR code valid and do your details match your ID? Then you’re allowed to enter. You might also need an entry ticket.

**Please note:** you can show proof for only one person in the CoronaCheck app. Every visitor either needs their own phone with the app, or a printed test result or proof of vaccination. Download and print your proof on [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print).
