title: Can we, as a test location, connect with the CoronaCheck app?

Yes, thatâ€™s possible. In the CoronaCheck app or via [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) your clients can generate a QR code that serves as their test certificate.

More information on the procedure and the requirements? Check the website of the [Dutch Rijksoverheid](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/aansluiten-CoronaCheck).
