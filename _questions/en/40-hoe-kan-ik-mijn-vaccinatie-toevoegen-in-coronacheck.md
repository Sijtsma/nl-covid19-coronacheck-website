title: How can I add my vaccination (that I received abroad) to CoronaCheck later?
---
In the course of June, you will be able to add your vaccination to CoronaCheck. From that moment on, you can request your vaccination details by logging in to the CoronaCheck app or website using your DigiD. Your details will be automatically retrieved from systems used by RIVM (if youâ€™ve given permission), GGD and hospitals. 

Are your vaccination details saved in another system, for example one used by your general practitioner? Or have you been vaccinated abroad? You can find more information about it soon on <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-vaccinatie/vraag-en-antwoord/wat-is-het-eu-digitaal-corona-certificaat" hreflang="nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" lang="nl">Wat is het EU Digitaal Corona Certificaat? | Rijksoverheid.nl</a>.
