To retrieve your vaccination details in CoronaCheck, you need a valid DigiD. <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/apply-or-activate-digid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You can request it via this link</a>.  A request for a new DigiD takes a couple of working days to process.

You can log in with DigiD via the app (<a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/login-methods/digid-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the DigiD app here</a>) or via the DigiD website, using SMS verification. <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/login-methods/sms-verification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read more about setting up SMS verification here</a>.

Do you need more information about DigiD? Contact the Helpdesk on  {{ site.data.translations.phone-digid-helpdesk[page.lang] }} (reachable on working days from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and during weekends, between 12 p.m. and 10 p.m.).

If you donâ€™t have a DigiD or no digital means, please call the CoronaCheck Helpdesk. 


## Error message

Do you already have a DigiD but are you unable to log in? This is what you can do: 

- If it is too busy, please try again later;
- Close all browsers where you have DigiD open, delete the CoronaCheck-app and re-install, and try again;
- Sometimes it is necessary to manually clear your browser cache and then log in again through CoronaCheck;
- Change your internet connection, for example stop or try using wi-fi and try again;
- Restart your phone and try again;
- Try logging in to DigiD from another device.

Is it still not possible to log in? Please contact the DigiD helpdesk on {{ site.data.translations.phone-digid-helpdesk[page.lang] }} (reachable on working days from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and during weekends, between 12 p.m. and 10 p.m.).
