No, itâ€™s currently not possible to get access with a vaccination declaration. When you have been vaccinated, you still need a negative test result to get access.

At this time, it is unclear to which extent you can still transmit coronavirus when you have been vaccinated. It may be possible to get access by means of a vaccination declaration in the future. This is still being investigated.
