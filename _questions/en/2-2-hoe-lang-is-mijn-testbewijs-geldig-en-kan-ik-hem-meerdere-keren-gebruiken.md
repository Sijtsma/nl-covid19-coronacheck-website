A test certificate is valid until 40 hours after the moment of testing. So within these 40 hours, you’re able to visit multiple locations or activities with your certificate (the QR code). And have the QR code scanned again and again. A proof of vaccination is valid for at least 365 days. This QR code may also be scanned multiple times.

The chances you infect other people within the first 48 hours after the moment of testing are small. That’s why you’re only able to gain entry until 40 hours after the moment of testing. In this case, we assume an activity lasts no longer than 8 hours.

Good to know: in 'my overview’ in the CoronaCheck app, you can check how long the QR code is still valid for. But please note: you can only check the validity of the Dutch QR code.
