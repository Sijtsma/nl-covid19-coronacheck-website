title: Why do I need a test certificate if I’ve also got a test result?
---
There are 2 reasons for this:

- A test certificate includes a digital autograph. This autograph makes the result difficult to change or forge.
- A test certificate is more privacy-friendly than a test result. A test certificate includes far less personal information than a test result – only your initials, birth month, and day of birth.
