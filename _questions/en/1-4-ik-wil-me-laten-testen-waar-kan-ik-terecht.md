To enter certain locations or activities, you must first get tested for coronavirus. You can apply for a test with the organiser of the event or activity. The organiser will know where you can get tested.

## No symptoms?
Get tested via one of the test locations that is affiliated with Testen voor Toegang.

## When experiencing symptoms
Experiencing symptoms that could indicate COVID-19, like cold symptoms, coughing, shortness of breath, elevated temperature or fever? Get tested at the GGD. Please note: a negative test result from the GGD currently does not generate a test certificate.
