You may use a positive test result to create a recovery certificate with CoronaCheck. A number of rules apply:

- The recovery certificate is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the recovery certificate may be created earlier.
- For a recovery certificate valid in the Netherlands, the positive test result can be a maximum of 365 days old.
- For a recovery certificate valid abroad, the positive test result can be a maximum of 180 days old.

Paper certificates, issued before November 30th, will stay valid for 180 days (when they are added to the app as well). Do you want to retrieve a recovery certificate that is valid for 365 days? Retrieve your positive result on [coronacheck.nl/print](/en/print) using DigiD.

**Please note:** It has been agreed in a European context that a recovery certificate may only be issued on the basis of a PCR test. For use within the Netherlands (for example for access to events), a recovery certificate is also issued based on an antigen test. A recovery certificate is never provided on the basis of a self-test or a serological test.

For all rules regarding creating a recovery certificate, please look at the page {{ site.data.links.herstelbewijs[page.lang] }}.
