A Dutch test certificate is valid until 24 hours after the moment of testing. Within these 24 hours, you’re able to visit multiple locations or activities with your certificate (the QR code). Please note: a test done by the GGD often isn’t available in CoronaCheck within 24 hours.

A Dutch recovery certificate becomes valid 11 days after the positive test, until 180 days after the positive test.

A Dutch vaccination certificate is valid from 14 days after the second vaccination. Vaccinations with Janssen become valid from 28 days after vaccination. A full vaccination certificate is valid for 270 days. Once you've received a new (booster)vaccination, you can add it yourself by logging in again with DigiD. A decision about the validity of booster vaccinations has not been made yet. 

For children up to 18 years old, a full vaccination certificate is valid indefinitely. This does not require a booster injection.

Do you have a paper certificate? A paper certificate is valid for a maximum of 90 days. You can print a new certificate after via [coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) (as long as your vaccination or recovery is still valid).

The validity of paper coronavirus passes cannot be adjusted remotely. Therefore, on April 1st 2022 all paper coronavirus passes issued before February 1st 2022 will expire. These certificates have to be reprinted.

Are you traveling to another country? Rules and regulations differ from country to country. Check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} before you leave to see what certificate you need and if your international QR-code is valid at your destination.
