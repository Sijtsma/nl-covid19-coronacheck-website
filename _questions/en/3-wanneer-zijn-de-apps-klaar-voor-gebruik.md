From June 5, you need a negative test result to enter certain locations and activities. With CoronaCheck, you turn this test result into a personal QR code. Show the QR code and your proof of identity at the entrance.

From early July, you can use CoronaCheck to turn your vaccination certificate into a personal QR code. You can use it in The Netherlands or to travel to other countries in the European Union.
