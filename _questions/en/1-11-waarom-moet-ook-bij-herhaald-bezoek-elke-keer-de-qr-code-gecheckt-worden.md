title: Why does the QR code have to be checked every time, even on repeat visits, for example to the gym?
---
With the QR code in CoronaCheck, a person shows they are fully vaccinated, have recovered or tested negative. Because of privacy laws, the person scanning shouldn't know which of these coronavirus passes a visitor carries. If someone gets a green tick because of a negative test, then it will only be valid for 24 hours. If someone does not get tested after that - and is not checked again on repeat visits - then this person is mistakenly granted access.
