title: Despite my negative test result, the GGD orders me to self-isolate. What do I do?
---
Follow the GGD’s recommendations and stay in quarantine. The negative test result is only a reflection of the time of testing.

The self-isolation takes 10 days. It’s advised to take another test on day 5. If you get a negative result, you can end your self-isolation.

**Please note:** a negative test result from the GGD currently does <u>not</u> generate a test certificate in the CoronaCheck app. This also applies to other commercial test providers.
