Yes, that’s possible. But it won’t be necessary. As long as your certificate or entry pass is valid, it’ll stay in the app. In case something does go wrong and you’re unable to load the certificate or pass in the app, you can always print it at [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print).

**Please note**: you can only use the CoronaCheck app to show the certificate or entry pass of one person. So every visitor needs their own phone (with the app installed) or a printed certificate or entry pass.
