If youâ€™re traveling with the CoronaCheck app, personal details are visible during checks at location entrances or border controls. This is due to an official agreement within Europe (Digital Coronavirus Certificate). 

Depending on the certificate, the inspector sees:

- The type of test, the date of testing, and the test result, or;
- The type of vaccine, the vaccination date, and the test result, or;
- The recovery certificate details;
- Your first and last name;
- Your date of birth.

The [CoronaCheck app privacy statement](/en/privacy) also includes an overview of all personal details.
