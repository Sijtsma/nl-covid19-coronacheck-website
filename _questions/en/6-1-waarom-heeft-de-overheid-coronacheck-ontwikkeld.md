title: Why did the government develop CoronaCheck?
---
The government is working hard to responsibly open society back up. Thanks to CoronaCheck, visitors may gain entry to certain locations or activities. And they may travel again. But only if they’re vaccinated or a test shows they don’t have coronavirus at the moment.
 
CoronaCheck was developed to show you’ve been vaccinated or were recently tested for coronavirus. There are 3 reasons why:
 
1. A certificate or entry pass in CoronaCheck includes a digital autograph. This autograph makes personal details hard to change or forge.

2. A certificate or entry pass in CoronaCheck is more privacy-friendly than a test result, registration card, or vaccination booklet. This is because CoronaCheck includes much fewer personal details: only your initials, birth month and day of birth.
