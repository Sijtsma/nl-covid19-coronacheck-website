Some Dutch locations require a coronavirus pass for access. Imagine a festival or a football match, for example. If this is the case, the organizer will provide more information.

If you want to cross the border, you'll often need a coronavirus pass too. Please note that rules differ from country to country. Which type of test or vaccination is sufficient, for example. You can read more about this on {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }}.
