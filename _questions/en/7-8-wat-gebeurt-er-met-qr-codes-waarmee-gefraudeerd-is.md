title: What happens to QR codes that have been tampered with?
---
As of version 2.4.0., the Scanner for CoronaCheck has the option to block specific QR codes. QR codes and coronavirus passes are personal, and may not be used by others. Sharing QR codes and using another person's QR codes is punishable by law and will be reported if misuse is detected. If QR codes are widely shared on the internet or on social media, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport can block these codes. In that case, the Scanner app will show a red screen, and the person cannot be admitted. 

Always check the proof of identity, to prevent people from trying to gain access with someone else's QR code.
