A paper coronavirus pass you received from your healthcare provider can be added to the CoronaCheck app. This way you can use the certificate on your phone. This is how it works: 

1. Open the CoronaCheck app
2. Go to the menu
3. Click on 'Add paper certificate' and follow the steps in the app. 

A certificate from the government of a different country cannot be added to the CoronaCheck app this way. This has to do with legislation. Did you get a certificate from the government of another country? Then please use the app from that specific country.
