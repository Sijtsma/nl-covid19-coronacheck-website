No vaccination found? There are several causes. [Find more information here](/en/guidepost).  Were you recently vaccinated? Then it may take a while before the details are available.
 
No negative test result found? There are several causes:

## You were tested, but your test result hasn’t been processed yet

It may take a few hours before the test location finishes processing your result. Please try again later. Were you tested longer than a few hours ago? Contact the test location.

## Your test result is positive

A positive test result means you had coronavirus at the moment of testing. This means you can’t make a test certificate in the form of a QR code. In this case, the test provider notifies the GGD of your result. The GGD will then phone you for their contact tracing research.
