title: What is a certificate of recovery, and how long is it valid for?
---
A certificate of recovery is proof of a positive test result. This way you can prove youâ€™ve had coronavirus sometime during the past 6 months and have since recovered. You can only create a certificate of recovery if your positive test is registered at the GGD. 

In the Netherlands, your certificate of recovery is valid from 11 days after the positive test.  After that, the certificate is valid until day 180 after your positive test result. You cannot have any symptoms if you want to use your certificate of recovery.

## Antigen test vs PCR test
An international QR code can only be made using a positive PCR test.
To create a domestic certificate of recovery both a positive test result of an antigen test and a PCR test are accepted.
Self-tests cannot be used to create a certificate of recovery.
