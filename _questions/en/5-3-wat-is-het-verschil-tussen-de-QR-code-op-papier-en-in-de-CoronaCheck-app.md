A paper certificate (the QR code) comes in handy for visitors or travellers who don’t own a smartphone. In the CoronaCheck app, the Dutch QR code automatically changes every few minutes. So an inspector sees a different code every time, which means you’re unable to trace.
 
Of course, a paper QR code is unable to change. Which is why the paper version offers less privacy. You can prevent this by regularly printing a new QR code.
