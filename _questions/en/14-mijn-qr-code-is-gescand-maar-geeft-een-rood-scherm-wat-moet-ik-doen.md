title: My QR code has been scanned but gives a red screen. What do I do?

A red screen means your QR code is not valid. Always display your QR code directly from the CoronaCheck app. A screenshot or other duplicate of a QR code is not valid and will lead to a red screen.

Here’s what you can do:

- Always display your QR code directly from the CoronaCheck app. A screenshot or copy from the QR code from the app will always generate a red screen
- Check the time on your phone. If it’s incorrect, this can result in a red screen.
- Close the CoronaCheck app. Restart the app and have your QR code scanned again
- Keep getting a red screen despite having a valid test declaration? Contact the CoronaCheck helpdesk by phone at <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>

You’ll always need a green screen to get access, which is why you need to display your valid QR code, either digitally or printed. Don’t have a valid test declaration? Then, unfortunately, you’re not allowed access.
