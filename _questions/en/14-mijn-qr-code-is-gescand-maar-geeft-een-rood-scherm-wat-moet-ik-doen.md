title: My QR code was scanned but results in a red screen. What should I do now?

Red screen? That means your test certificate in the form of a QR code is invalid. So there’s no evidence of a recent negative test result, or your test certificate has expired. Here’s what you can do:

- Always show the QR code using the CoronaCheck app. A screenshot or copy of a QR code from the app will always lead to a red screen.
- Check the time on your phone. If the time on your phone is ahead, behind, or set to a different time zone, this can lead to a red screen.
- Completely close the CoronaCheck app. Then start it again and have your QR code scanned once more.
- Keep getting a red screen even though you have a valid test certificate? Contact the CoronaCheck helpdesk. Phone number: <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>

You always need a green screen to enter. So show your valid QR code in the app, or show the paper version. Don’t have a valid test certificate? Unfortunately, this means you can’t enter.
