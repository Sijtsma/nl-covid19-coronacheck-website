title: What is the difference between CoronaCheck and Coronapas?
---
In the Netherlands you can use the CoronaCheck app to retrieve your Dutch Corona Certificate and European Digital Corona Certificate. The CoronaCheck application can be downloaded free of charge from the Google Play Store and Apple App store.

The media often uses the term ‘coronapas’ or ‘coronapass’ when they refer to the CoronaCheck app.

Note: the Google Play Store and Apple App Store also contain an app called ‘coronpas’. This is the Danish counterpart of the CoronaCheck application. You cannot use the Danish app to retrieve your Dutch or European Corona Certificate in the Netherlands. If you have been vaccinated or tested in Denmark, you can use the ‘coronpas’ app to display your QR code in order to access events in the Netherlands.
