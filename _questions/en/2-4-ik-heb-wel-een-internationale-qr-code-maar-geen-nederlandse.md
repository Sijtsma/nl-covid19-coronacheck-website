In the Netherlands, you'll only receive a vaccination certificate if you were fully vaccinated. Or if you've had coronavirus and have been vaccinated once since. Read more here: {{ site.data.translations.buitenlandvaccinatie[page.lang] }}. Are you entitled to a Dutch vaccination certificate, but is the app not providing one? See what you can do below. 

## I've had coronavirus and received one vaccination 

### *GGD needs to be aware of your coronavirus infection*

The GGD needs to be aware you've had coronavirus. Therefore you need to state you've had coronavirus when planning your vaccination appointment. You'll only need one vaccination appointment.
Were you vaccinated by the GGD? Then the GGD can adjust this afterwards as well. Please contact the GGD via {{ site.data.translations.phone-ggd[page.lang] }}.

### *Another vaccination location: paper vaccination certificate*

Were you vaccinated by your general practitioner (GP), at the hospital or by another healthcare provider? Then you won't be able to adjust this. Your GP, the hospital or the healthcare provider that vaccinated you can print a paper vaccination certificate for you. To receive this document, please contact the instance that vaccinated you.

## Did you contract coronavirus between your first and second vaccination?

If you contract coronavirus after your first vaccination, you'll need to get a second vaccination to be fully vaccinated. After that, you'll be able to create a vaccination certificate in CoronaCheck.

## I received my two vaccinations on different locations

If you were vaccinated by the GGD or have given permission for registration at the RIVM, both vaccinations will be retrieved in CoronaCheck.Did you get your first vaccination at another provider, but your second at the GGD? When making an appointment at the GGD, please indicate that you got your first vaccination elsewhere. Did you not give permission to have your first vaccination registered at the RIVM? Then you can still ask your first vaccination provider to do this.
