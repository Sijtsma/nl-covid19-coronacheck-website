Unfortunately, this means your test result or vaccination isn’t valid in The Netherlands. That’s why only an international QR code was made. This code is valid outside The Netherlands.
 
There are several causes for this. For example, you might have only had one vaccination. Or maybe the validity in The Netherlands is shorter than the validity in other countries. Find more information and answers here: {{ site.data.translations.coronabewijs-hulp-link[page.lang] }}.

From the beginning of July, you can also get an international certificate - either from a test result, a vaccination or a recovery statement (if you were infected with coronavirus before).
