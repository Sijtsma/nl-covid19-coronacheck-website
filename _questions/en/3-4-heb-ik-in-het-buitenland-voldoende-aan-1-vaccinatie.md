title: Will one vaccination be enough to travel abroad?
---
One vaccination is enough to create an international vaccination certificate. This allows you to travel abroad. Please note: this doesn’t mean you can travel to any country. Check if the country you’re planning to visit allows proof of one vaccination. Before leaving, please read through the terms on {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }}. 

Within the Netherlands, you need to have both vaccinations to receive a vaccination certificate.
