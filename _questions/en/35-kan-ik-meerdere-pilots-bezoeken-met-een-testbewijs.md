title: Can I visit more than 1 location or activity with a test certificate?
---
Yes, you can.  A test certificate is valid until 40 hours after the moment you were tested. Within these 40 hours, you can use the test certificate (the QR code) to access several locations or activities. And have the QR code scanned repeatedly.
