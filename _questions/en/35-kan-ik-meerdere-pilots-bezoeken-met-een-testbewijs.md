title: Can I visit multiple pilot events with the same test certificate?
---
Yes, thatâ€™s allowed. A test certificate is valid for 40 hours after the time of testing. Within this time frame, you can use the same test certificate (QR code) for multiple events and have your QR scanned multiple times.
