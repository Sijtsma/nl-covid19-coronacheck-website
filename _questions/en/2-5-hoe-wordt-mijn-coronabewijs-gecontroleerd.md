Before you enter a location and activity in The Netherlands, an inspector uses the [CoronaCheck Scanner](/en/scanner) to check the validity of your test certificate or proof of vaccination. They do so by scanning the QR code at the entrance.
 
If your test certificate or proof of vaccination is valid, the inspector will see a green screen. This includes a minimal amount of your personal details: the first letter of your first name, the first letter of your last name, your birth month and your day of birth. These details are checked to see if they match with your proof of identity.
 
The inspector is never able to see whether your entry pass was created using a vaccination or a test result.
