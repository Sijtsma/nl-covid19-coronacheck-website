In some cases, you'd rather print a QR code. If you don't possess a smartphone, for example. Or if you want to create a QR code for your kids. Go to [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) and follow these steps. 

## Tested negative?

If you tested negative, you can enter your retrieval code on [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print). The retrieval code consists of letters and numbers and the testing location will send it to you by email or SMS. You'll receive it within a few hours. If you've been tested by the GGD, you can retrieve your details using DigiD. 

## Vaccination?

Log in using your DigiD. Vaccination details are retrieved from the systems of the RIVM, the GGD and connected general practitioners. It may take a few days for your vaccination to be registered. 

## Recovered from coronavirus?

You may use a positive test result to create a recovery certificate using CoronaCheck. A number of rules apply: 

- The positive test was carried out by the GGD
- The positive test result is a maximum of 180 days old
- The recovery certificate is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the recovery certificate may be created earlier

Please have the QR code scanned at the event you'd like to enter. Or at the border.

**Please note**: you can use the international QR code for locations in the country you're traveling to as well.
