When you’re visiting a country that requires proof, you can just use the CoronaCheck app. When asked, please show the international QR code. Stick to Covid-restrictions imposed by the country you’re travelling through. Check {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }} to verify if you can use CoronaCheck to gain access to certain locations.
