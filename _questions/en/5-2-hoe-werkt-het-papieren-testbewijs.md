Don’t have a smartphone? Or would you prefer a paper certificate? Go to [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) and follow these steps: 

1. Enter your retrieval code on [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print) You receive this code when you get vaccinated or when you get a negative test result. Or retrieve your details with DigiD.
2. After checking your retrieval code, CoronaCheck retrieves your result
3. Next, a Dutch QR code is made from your vaccination, positive / negative test result. 
4. Print your QR code and bring it with you

Have the QR code scanned at the entrance of the location you’d like to enter. Or at the border. Please note: you can also use the international QR code to enter locations in the country you’re traveling to. However, you must comply with local regulations to do so. Is your QR code valid and do your details match with your proof of identity? Then you may enter.
