title: What is the difference between the QR code on paper and the code in the CoronaCheck app? 
---
A paper test certificate (the QR code) is useful for visitors who do not have a smartphone. In the CoronaCheck app, the QR code changes every few minutes. A inspector therefore always sees a different QR code, so that you cannot be tracked.

This is not possible on paper. The paper version therefore offers less privacy. You can prevent this by regularly printing a new QR code.
