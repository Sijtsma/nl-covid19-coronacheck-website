title: What’s the difference between a QR code on paper and a QR code in the CoronaCheck app? 
---
A test certificate (QR code) on paper is handy for visitors who don’t have a smartphone. In the CoronaCheck app, the QR code automatically changes every few minutes. So an inspector will see a different QR code every time, making you untraceable. 

Because a QR code on paper doesn’t automatically change, the paper version offers less privacy. You can counter this by regularly printing a new QR code.
