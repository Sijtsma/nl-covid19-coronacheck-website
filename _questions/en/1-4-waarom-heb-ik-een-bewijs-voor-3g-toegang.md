A Dutch coronavirus entry pass currently gives you 3G access. This means you get access with a vaccination or recovery certificate, or a negative test anywhere in the Netherlands a coronavirus pass is required.

The cabinet has announced that the measures against COVID-19 will change as of 25 February. From that moment, the coronavirus entry pass will no longer be used for 3G access in the Netherlands. You will then only get access with a negative test certificate (1G access). The test certificate is required only at indoor activities with more than 500 visitors, without a fixed seat. After you have tested negative, from 25 February, you can create a separate certificate in the CoronaCheck app that is valid for 1G access.
