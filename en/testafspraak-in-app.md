A negative test certificate is required for access to certain locations or activities. So get yourself tested beforehand.

## No symptoms?
Get tested via one of the test locations that is affiliated with Testen voor Toegang.

## When experiencing symptoms
Experiencing symptoms that could indicate COVID-19, like cold symptoms, coughing, shortness of breath, elevated temperature or fever? Get tested at the GGD. Please note: a negative test result from the GGD currently does not generate a test certificate.
