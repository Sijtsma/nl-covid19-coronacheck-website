title: CoronaCheck Privacy Statement
---
This privacy policy is written for the use of the CoronaCheck app and the CoronaCheck Scanner app during pilots held from 22 April 2021 onwards and outlines how personal information of visitors of a pilot event (hereinafter: users) is processed and which technical and organisational measures have been taken to protect this personal information. A second option in addition to the CoronaCheck app is to print off a hard copy of the test declaration. This privacy statement also outlines how to generate a hard copy of your test declaration

This privacy statement therefore does not apply to versions of the CoronaCheck app and the CoronaCheck Scanner app deployed before 23 April 2021 and this privacy statement is limited to the version of the CoronaCheck apps used for pilot events.

## About CoronaCheck and the printed test declaration

The CoronaCheck app is a technical tool that enables you to show digital proof of a recent negative test for the COVID-19 virus. Alternatively, you can generate a test declaration at coronacheck.nl and print off as a hard copy. When this privacy statement refers to the website coronacheck.nl, it’s specifically intended to refer to the option on coronacheck.nl to generate a test declaration. The test declaration is proof that someone has tested negative and has temporary validity. This proof is one of the prerequisites for accessing specific events organised on a pilot basis. Following is a brief outline of how to generate a test declaration the CoronaCheck app and how to generate a printed test declaration. The following description covers more than the actual processing of personal data that takes place within the CoronaCheck app and on coronacheck.nl and has been included in this statement to give insight into the end-to-end process.

If you visit a pilot event, you first take a corona test at the designated test provider for that pilot event. You will receive the test results from the test provider. Along with your test results, you will receive a code. You then have 2 options to generate your test declaration. We describe both options: (1) generating a test declaration via the CoronaCheck app (digital test declaration) and (2) generating a test declaration to print off as a hard copy (printed test declaration). 

### CoronaCheck (digital test declaration)

You can download the CoronaCheck app on your mobile phone from the App Store or Google Play Store. When the app is installed, you will receive an explanation of how the app works. Permission is requested for the use of your personal information. After giving permission for processing your personal information, you can use the app. You can enter the code you have received with your test results into the CoronaCheck app. If a test result is available, you will receive an additional verification code via SMS. Enter this code in your CoronaCheck app. After checking both codes, the CoronaCheck app will retrieve your negative test results. You can convert these test results into a test declaration by pressing the ‘Make QR’ button. The test results are then digitally signed by a so-called signing service. After signing, the CoronaCheck app creates a test declaration in the form of a QR code. Your identifying data is part of this QR code in order to prevent fraud when presenting QR codes to a scanner. The identifying data includes your first name initial, your last name initial, your day of birth and your month of birth. To combat fraud, the scanner checks if these details are in correspondence with your proof of identity.

To get access to a pilot event, you have your QR code (in the app or on paper) scanned at the entrance. The scanner at the entrance uses the CoronaCheck Scanner app to scan your QR code. Do you have a valid QR code as well as an admission ticket? Then you’re welcome to enter.

The QR code is valid for 40 hours (both digital and on paper). This is calculated from the time of taking the COVID-19 test.

### 1. Who is responsible for processing personal information?

The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport is responsible for the processing of personal information in the CoronaCheck app, the website coronacheck.nl (to the extent that the website is used to generate a test declaration) and the processing of personal data in the signing service. The Minister is not responsible for any other processing of personal information that takes place outside the app or the website coronacheck.nl (to the extent that the website is used to generate a test declaration).  

### 2. Grounds for processing of personal information

The grounds for processing personal information within the CoronaCheck app, on coronacheck.nl and the signing service is the consent of the user. This consent is given in CoronaCheck by a user after installing the app on the user’s mobile phone and taking note of this privacy statement. When using the website coronacheck.nl, consent is required before a user can fill out their token. Within the CoronaScanner app, no personal information is processed.  

### 3. For what purpose is personal information processed?

The government is working hard to open society in a responsible manner. Testing visitors for the COVID-19 virus before entering a public event or public location is part of this. Such access tests allow social, cultural and sports locations to be opened responsibly and quicker during times of corona. Showing a negative test result gives visitors access to these types of venues. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors to show digital proof of their negative test declaration, allowing them access to these locations. Visitors can also generate a test declaration on the website coronacheck.nl to print off as a hard copy without having to use the CoronaCheck app.

### 4. Which personal information is processed?

The CoronaCheck app and coronacheck.nl proces the following personal information:

- The test results of your COVID-19 test
- The first letter of your first name
- The first letter of your last name
- Your day and month of birth
- An IP address

Test results – The test results that the CoronaCheck app or coronacheck.nl retrieves from the test station contain information about the test: whether or not it is a negative test, the date and time the test was taken, the type of test (e.g. PCR test), test station identification and a unique random number. This unique random number is provided by the test station and is not related to a person. These random numbers are assigned to be able to avoid double issuance of test declarations. 

The following information is provided by the test provider: the first letter of your first name, the first letter of your last name, your day and month of birth. This information is used for verification when the test results are retrieved. This proves that the test results that have been retrieved are yours. This information is not displayed to the CoronaCheck Scanner app when your QR code is scanned to access a location. 

Test declaration – The test declaration (in the form of a QR code) contains part of the information included in the test results: the type of test and the date and time the test was taken (rounded to the nearest hour).

Digital signature – This is placed to ensure the test declaration cannot be modified. Within the process, the digital signature in itself is not personal information as such, but signing a test result is necessary to be able to use the CoronaCheck app and coronacheck.nl.

The IP address is also used. This is inherent to the use of internet and IP technology and is a technical requirement to establish a connection between the test station server and your phone. The IP address is only processed for management and security purposes. The IP address is ‘stripped’ by the provider Prolocation B.V. before receipt by the signing server.

The test declaration (both digital and printed) is scanned by the CoronaCheck Scanner app. This shows if the user has a negative and valid test declaration. The scanner also checks if the identifying data on the digital or printed test declaration (first name initial, last name initial, day of birth and month of birth) matches the visitor’s proof of identity. The CoronaCheck Scanner app does not process any personal data. 

Finally, the device information is processed (the installed version of the CoronaCheck app and the operating system of your mobile phone). This is recorded to able to investigate issues and installation possibilities and inform users about this.

The website coronacheck.nl which also includes this privacy statement does not use cookies.

### 5. Statistical information

The data collected with the CoronaCheck app and coronacheck.nl is used exclusively for the stated purposes in this privacy statement. 

### 6. Who can access the data?

The digital signing of the test declaration is done by Prolocation B.V. To this end, Prolocation B.V. processes the IP address on behalf of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and takes the role of data processor under GDPR. Appropriate agreements have been made with Prolocation B.V. to guarantee the protection of personal data.

### 7. How long is personal data retained?

Within the CoronaCheck app and at coronacheck.nl, personal information is kept as follows:

- You can generate a digital test declaration in the CoronaCheck app. The test declaration is valid for maximum 40 hours, calculated from the time the test was taken. After the test declaration has expired, the test declaration and QR code are automatically deleted when opening the app.
- You can generate a test declaration via coronacheck.nl to print off as a hard copy of your test declaration. The QR code (including identifying data) is deleted when you close the browser containing the QR code. If you don’t close the browser manually, the QR code in the browser will automatically disappear after 40 hours. 
- The IP address processed for management and security purposes by our provider Prolocation B.V. is deleted after maximum 7 days. 
- The CoronaCheck Scanner app does not save any personal information. 



### 8. What permissions does the CoronaCheck Scanner app need?

The CoronaCheck Scanner needs camera permissions. This permission is necessary to scan the test declaration, in the form of a QR code, from the CoronaCheck app. This permission is optional. Without permission, the user can install the app but cannot use it to scan the test declaration in the form of a QR code.
