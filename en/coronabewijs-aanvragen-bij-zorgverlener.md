title: Requesting a paper coronavirus pass from the healthcare provider who vaccinated or tested you
---
In some specific cases, you can request a paper coronavirus pass from the healthcare provider who vaccinated or tested you.

This is only possible in some specific cases, when you cannot retrieve your vaccination or test data in CoronaCheck. For instance because:

- Your date of birth is unknown
- Your name does not completely match with the name on your passport, and you got tested at your general practitioner, the hospital or another care institution
- You only received one vaccination because you recovered from coronavirus, and you got tested at the general practitioner, the hospital or another care provider.

Contact the healthcare provider who vaccinated or tested you.

**Please note:** in the following cases, it’s not possible to request a paper coronavirus pass from your healthcare provider:

- If you’ve been vaccinated abroad. You can read more about this on {{ site.data.translations.coronabewijs-hulp-link[page.lang] }}.
- If you can retrieve  your coronavirus pass yourself through the CoronaCheck app or [www.coronacheck.nl/en/print](/en/print). 
- If you don’t have a DigiD or necessary digital resources. Please contact the CoronaCheck helpdesk by telephone.
