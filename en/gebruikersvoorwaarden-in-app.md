## About the terms of use

These terms of use outline the functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app, how to use the app, and your rights and responsibilities. Make sure to read these terms carefully before acceptance. By accepting these terms, you confirm to the VWS that you have read, understand and agree with these terms. If you don’t agree with these terms, you cannot install the CoronaCheck Scanner app.  

## How does the CoronaCheck Scanner app work?

### Download and installation

The CoronaCheck Scanner app is required to check the validity of digital corona admissition tickets in both the CoronaCheck-app as well as hard copy corona admissition tickets printed off on paper. The CoronaCheck Scanner app is available free of charge in the App Store (for iOS) and Google Play Store (for Android) and can be installed on a smartphone or tablet. Make sure you only download the CoronaCheck Scanner app from the App Store or Google Play Store and be aware of fake or counterfeit apps. The CoronaCheck Scanner app is only supported from iOS version 11 and Android version 6 and up.

After downloading the CoronaCheck Scanner app and agreeing to these terms, you can use the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Before you can use this app, you need to read and agree to the terms of use. You can find these terms of use on the [CoronaCheck website](https://coronacheck.nl/en/gebruikersvoorwaarden.html).

### Scanning a corona admission ticket

When presenting a corona admission ticket to the scanner, the validity of the corona admission ticket can be verified by using the CoronaCheck Scanner app. A person can display a digital corona admission ticket in the CoronaCheck-app or show a hard copy of the corona admission ticket generated and printed via coronacheck.nl. Validating a corona admission ticket does not require an interne connection. When a digital corona admission ticket is scanned with CoronaCheck Scanner, the QR code should have a visual motion animation as a security check. This allows the scanner to confirm they haven’t made a still screenshot of the QR code in the CoronaCheck-app. In addition, both digital and hard copy corona admission tickets contain identifying data (first name initial, last name initial, day of birth and month of birth). Note that the CoronaCheck Scanner app does not save this data, or processes this data in any other manner. The QR code and identifying data is only verified by the CoronaCheck Scanner app to confirm a 'valid corona admission ticket’ (green screen) or 'not valid corona admission ticket’ (red screen). It’s possible a grey screen is displayed when scanning a QR code. This only happens after scanning a QR code developed to test the functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. A grey code does not give any information about a person but is simply a reflection of a test code. When the status 'no valid corona admission ticket’ (red screen) is displayed, it will also include a general description outlining possible causes for this status. In addition to scanning the QR code, the scanner also needs to verify the person’s identity by checking their proof of identity. This is a physical check of proof of identity; no (copy of) proof of identity is saved or stored in any way. 
Accompanied by the correct and moving motion animation (when using the CoronaCheck-app) and a green screen after scanning the corona admission ticket, the scanner can allow access to the event or location. 

### Updates

It’s important to use the latest version of the app. You also need to use the newest operating system for Apple or Android (Google). If you’re not using the latest updates, the app may not work properly.

To prevent abuse and/or malfunctions and/or other issues, please ensure your devices and connections are adequately protected against unauthorised third-party use, malware, Trojans and viruses.

### More information

For more information on the (technical) functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app, please refer to the information as published on Github. This information is not legally binding and does not guarantee the workings of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. 

### Uninstalling the app

If you no longer wish to use the app, you can uninstall the CoronaCheck Scanner app from the smartphone or tablet on which the CoronaCheck Scanner app is installed.

## For whom is the CoronaCheck Scanner app intended?

The app is publicly available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. A scanner is able to deny access with the CoronaCheck Scanner app if persons are unable to display a corona admission ticket or when the CoronaCheck Scanner app shows a red screen after scanning a corona admission ticket. 

## Reason for developing the CoronaCheck Scanner app 

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (hereinafter: “coronavirus”) has tremendous social impact on Dutch society. By containing and controlling coronavirus, society can slowly return to normal and economical damage can be limited as much as possible. The CoronaCheck Scanner app is intended to scan corona admission ticket in the CoronaCheck-app or a printed corona admission ticket to help ascertain if someone is allowed access to a certain location. By only allowing access to certain locations to people who can prove they have recently tested negative for coronavirus, further spread of coronavirus can be limited.

## The CoronaCheck Scanner app does not offer protection from coronavirus

Scanning a corona admission ticket indicates that a person was not infected with coronavirus at the time of testing. This does not guarantee that this person cannot infect others with coronavirus at the time of scanning the QR code with the CoronaCheck Scanner app.   

## Privacy

The use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app does not involve processing of personal data. The CoronaCheck Scanner app requires consent to use the scanner’s phone camera. This consent is required to scan the corona admission ticket, in the form of a QR code. Without this consent the user can install the app but cannot use the app to scan the corona admission ticket, in the form of a QR code. 

### Purpose limitation

The CoronaCheck Scanner app is used to regulate access to a certain event or location by checking if someone has a corona admission ticket. This is only possible when a person has received a negative test result from an affiliated test provider and has converted this into a corona admission ticket. When using the CoronaCheck Scanner app, it is not allowed to capture a corona admission ticket  in any way, including but not limited to taking a screenshot. The CoronaCheck Scanner app may only be used to read a corona admission ticket. Saving or recording corona admission tickets presented to a scanner is strictly prohibited. 

## Security

When using CoronaCheck Scanner, connections are secured and encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate pinning. This is combined with PKI Overheid certificates and certificate pinning. This means the CoronaCheck Scanner app only connects to servers with certificates issued by PKI Overheid (Dutch Government). 

Important configuration files, e.g. in which the functioning of the app can be influenced, are digitally signed. This process also exclusively uses and accepts certificates issues under the supervision of the Dutch Government.


## Functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app

The CoronaCheck Scanner app has been designed with great care. VWS works hard to make sure the app functions as well as possible and continues to develop and improve. Despite these efforts, VWS cannot guarantee that the CoronaCheck Scanner app functions flawlessly or without interruptions. It could happen that the CoronaCheck Scanner app is unable to read a QR code properly, for example.

By accepting these terms of use, you agree that CoronaCheck may not function flawlessly, may not be available temporarily, partially, permanently or entirely and that notifications are not received or processed by you timely and/or fully.

Do you have a question or complaint about the CoronaCheck Scanner app or do you want to report a malfunction? Please consult the [CoronaCheck website](https://coronacheck.nl/en).  

## Liability

VWS is not liable for any damages suffered through the use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. VWS does not accept any liability for the consequences of any inaccuracies in the data made available in the app. VWS can stop offering the app or change the content at any time (also [see Termination of the CoronaCheck Scanner app](#termination-of-the-coronacheck-scanner-app)). 

VWS it not liable for any damage or costs incurred by you or third parties, for whatever reasons, as a result of the use or inability to use the app. 

## Intellectual property rights

You hereby obtain a right to use the CoronaCheck Scanner app. This right of use is non-exclusive, non-transferable, cancellable, non-sublicenseable. The app, all copy and images in the app and the software in the app are property of VWS. 

## Change of terms

VWS may change the terms if and when VWS deems necessary. The date and version valid at the time of accepting the terms are listed at the bottom of the terms. If after installation you do not agree with the (change of) terms, you must uninstall the CoronaCheck Scanner app. 

## Termination of the CoronaCheck Scanner app

Checking corona admission tickets to allow access is a temporary crisis measure. This means it cannot be predicted what will happen in the future. For this reason, VWS can decide at any time to terminate use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Should this happen, you will be informed via the [CoronaCheck website](https://coronacheck.nl/en).  


## Applicable law and competent court

These terms are subject to Dutch law. Any dispute with VWS in relation to these terms or the use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app will be settled by the court in The Hague. 

## Other

If any part of these terms is illegal, not valid or unenforceable, such will not affect the remaining terms. You agree that when VWS does not make use of the rights set out in this condition, this cannot be construed as a waiver of rights. 

## Contact
