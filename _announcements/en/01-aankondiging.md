On Friday morning, January 28, some people were not able to use their Corona certificate. This was the case with:

- People who had a Corona infection before their first vaccination, and a booster shot
- People who have received a Janssen vaccination and a booster shot

For these people, a waiting period was wrongly assigned to the certificate. This issue was resolved around 1pm. When you retrieve your data via DigiD and create your certificate again, everything works properly.
