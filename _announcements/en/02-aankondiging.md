The Cabinet intends to make several changes to the coronavirus entry pass as of 1 February:
 
- The vaccination certificate is valid for 270 days after complete vaccination. No validity has yet been established for booster vaccination;
- The recovery certificate is valid for up to 180 days after the positive test;
 
As a result the rules for the coronavirus entry pass in the Netherlands and the International coronavirus pass (EU DCC) used to travel, are equalized as much as possible.
