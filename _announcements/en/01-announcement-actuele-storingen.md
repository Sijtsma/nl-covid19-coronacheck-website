<p>Tested at the GGD and your test result is not yet in the CoronaCheck app? This can take up to 30 hours after testing. If you can view your test result on the website <a href="https://www.coronatest.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" hreflang="nl">www.coronatest.nl</a>, it will take a few more hours before you can retrieve this data in the app. At Schiphol, the GGD helps travelers who do not yet have the results in the app with a replacement corona certificate. The GGD desk is located between arrival halls 3 and 4.</p>

<p> Do you want to travel and your corona certificate is not approved, while it is valid according to <a href="https://www.wijsopreis.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" hreflang="nl">wijsopreis.nl</a> ? Check if your proof is on international. If so? click on the "?" next to your QR code. Here is what your QR code is based on. Show this to the carrier. Most carriers will let you through anyway.</p>
