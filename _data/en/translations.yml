footer-logos-info_md: CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner have been developed by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport. Both the apps and the certificate on paper would not have been possible without the support of dozens of specialists, hands-on experts and a large open-source community of citizens. They all lent a hand and helped to test the app during its development.
