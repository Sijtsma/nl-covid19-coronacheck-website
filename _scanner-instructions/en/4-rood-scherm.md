Red screen? This does not mean the visitor has coronavirus. It just means the QR code is invalid or expired (older than 40 hours). So there is no proof of a recent negative test result. Here's what you can do:

- Check whether the visitor shows the QR code using the CoronaCheck app. A screenshot or copy of the QR code always results in a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to completely close the app and open it again. Then scan the QR code again.
- Check the time on the visitor's phone. If the time on the visitor's phone is incorrect, it will result in a red screen.  
- Do you keep getting a red screen even though the visitor has a negative test result? Direct the visitor to our help desk, phone number: <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>. 

A green screen is always needed for entry. Does the visitor not have a (valid) QR code? Then you cannot let them enter.
