Red screen? This does not mean the visitor has coronavirus. It just means the QR code is invalid or expired (older than 24 hours). So there is no proof of a  vaccination record, recovery or recent negative test result. Here's what you can do:

- Check whether the visitor shows the QR code using the CoronaCheck app. A screenshot or copy of the QR code always results in a red screen.
- Check whether the visitor shows a Dutch QR code.  Scanning an international QR code in the CoronaCheck-app will result in a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to completely close the app and open it again. Then scan the QR code again. 
- Do you keep getting a red screen even though the visitor has a vaccination record, recent positive or negative test result? Direct the visitor to our help desk, phone number: {{ site.data.links.phone-helpdesk[page.lang] }} (if you are calling from abroad: {{ site.data.links.phone-helpdesk-abroad[page.lang] }}). 

A green screen is always needed for entry. Does the visitor not have a (valid) QR code? Then you cannot let them enter.
