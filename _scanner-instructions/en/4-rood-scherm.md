#### Here’s what you can do:

1. Verify if the time on the visitor’s phone is set correctly.
2. Verify if the visitor is showing an original certificate. A screenshot of a certificate may cause problems.
3. Ask the visitor to completely shut down the app and restart it. Please scan the QR code again after.

#### Still looking at a red screen?

Please ask the visitor to contact the CoronaCheck help desk.
Without a green screen, you can’t grant the visitor access.
