For visitors aged 14 and over, always verify if the details on your screen are the same as those on the visitor's identity document. This way you can ensure the QR code belongs to the visitor. 

Please note: sometimes not all details are shown. This is done to protect the visitor's privacy. You will see a hyphen (-) in the field. In this case, verify only the details you're seeing.

All good? Then the visitor is allowed to enter and the check is done.
