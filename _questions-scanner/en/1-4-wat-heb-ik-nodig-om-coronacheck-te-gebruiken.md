In order to be able to scan your visitors’ coronavirus passes, you need the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Employees can download the CoronaCheck Scanner app in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/coronacheck/id1548269870) (iPhone) or in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.rijksoverheid.ctr.holder) (Android). They can use it to scan visitors’ QR codes at the entrance.

CoronaCheck Scanner works on all iOS and Android phones with Android 6 and iOS 12 and up (iPhone 5s and newer). You also need a working phone camera. Please note: It may be difficult to scan paper coronavirus passes with a phone with low camera quality. Therefor, do a trial with the scanning of QR-codes before the event with [these demo QR-codes.](/en/scanner/uitproberen)

You don’t need an internet connection to scan for access at the entrance. You do need an internet connection every day minimum to sync the configuration of the app.

All information on the use of CoronaCheck Scanner can be found on the page [How does scanning work](/en/scanner/zo-werkt-scannen).
