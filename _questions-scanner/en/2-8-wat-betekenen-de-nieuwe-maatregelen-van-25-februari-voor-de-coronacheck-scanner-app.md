title: 'What do the new measures of 25 February mean for my coronavirus entry pass?'
---
The government has announced that the corona virus measures will change as of February 25. From that moment on, the corona virus entry pass will no longer be used for 3G access (access with a vaccination, recovery or test certificate). On <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate/coronavirus-entry-pass/where-do-i-need-to-show-a-coronavirus-entry-pass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain locations</a>, the corona virus entry pass is still necessary. Visitors can only get access with a test certificate at those locations (1G access). 

The CoronaCheck scanner app is adjusted so that the app only gives a green screen with checkmark after scanning a test certificate. Scanning a vaccination or recovery certificate will result in a red screen with cross.
