No, at all times the visitor must be able to show a valid proof of identity and certificate.

You can check the validity of a certificate with the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Green screen? That means the visitor’s certificate is valid. You can now check if the identifying data on the green screen match the details on their proof of identity. All good? Then they’re allowed access. They may also need an additional entrance ticket.
