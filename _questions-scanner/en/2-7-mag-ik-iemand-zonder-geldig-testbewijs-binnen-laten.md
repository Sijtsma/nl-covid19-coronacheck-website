No, at all times the visitor must be able to show a valid proof of identity and certificate.

You can check the validity of a certificate with the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Green screen? That means the visitor’s certificate is valid. You can now check if the identifying data on the green screen match the details on their proof of identity. In order to protect the visitor’s privacy, not all data is displayed. Therefore, some fields may contain a hyphen (-). In that case, you only have to check the data that is displayed.

All good? Then they’re allowed access.
