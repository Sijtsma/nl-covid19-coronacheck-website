A red screen could mean that the QR code does not meet Dutch requirements, or that the QR code is blocked. QR codes that are widely shared via the internet or social media will be blocked.

## Here’s what you can do:

1. Verify if the time on the visitor’s phone and the scanner are set correctly. Make sure to set the date and time to ‘set automatically’.
2. Verify if the visitor is showing an original certificate. A screenshot of a certificate may cause problems.
3. Ask the visitor to completely shut down the app and restart it. Please scan the QR code again after.

## Still looking at a red screen? 
Please ask the visitor to contact the CoronaCheck help desk by phoning {{ site.data.links.phone-helpdesk[page.lang] }}. Or if you are calling from abroad: {{ site.data.links.phone-helpdesk-abroad[page.lang] }}.  

Without a green screen, you can’t grant the visitor access.
