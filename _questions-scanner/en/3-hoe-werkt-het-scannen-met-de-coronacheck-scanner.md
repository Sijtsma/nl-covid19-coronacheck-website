title: How does CoronaCheck Scanner work?
---
## 1. Keep distance

Press ‘Start Scan’ and ask the visitor to display their test declaration, either from the CoronaCheck app or printed off as a hard copy. The test declaration, in the form of a QR code, can be scanned from a safe distance. 

## 2. Scan the QR code

Aim your phone camera at the visitor’s test declaration and scan the QR code.

## 3. Green screen

Green screen? The visitor has a valid negative test certificate. Check if the identifying data on the green screen corresponds with the details on the proof of identity. All good? Then the visitor is allowed access. They may need an additional entrance ticket. 

## 4. Red screen
A red screen does not mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means the QR code is not valid. This means there is no proof of a recent negative test result, or the test declaration has expired (older than 40 hours). In this case:

- Check if the visitor has used a screenshot instead of the QR code directly from the app. Scanning a screenshot will lead to a red screen.
- Ask the visitor to restart the app. And try scanning again. 
- Keep getting a red screen while the visitor does have a negative test result? Please refer the visitor to our helpdesk at <a href="tel:0800-1421">0800-1421</a>.

At all times, a green screen is required for access. If the visitor doesn’t have a (valid) QR code, you can’t give them access. For more information, visit [www.coronacheck.nl/scanner](/en/scanner).
