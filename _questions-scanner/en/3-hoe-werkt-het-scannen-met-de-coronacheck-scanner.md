1. Open the CoronaCheck Scanner and press 'Start scanning'.
2. Ask the visitor to display their QR code.
On the visitor's screen, you'll see the QR code and an animation of a girl in a cycling motion. If the cycling girl isn't 'moving', it means the visitor has shown a screenshot of the QR code. In that case, ask the visitor to display the QR code directly from the CoronaCheck app. If you do scan a screenshot instead of the QR code from the CoronaCheck app, you'll get a red screen.
3. Scan the visitor's QR Code with the phone camera
4. 
    A. Green screen = access<br />
    A green screen confirms the visitor has a valid negative test declaration and is allowed access.  

    B. Red screen<br />
    A red display does not mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means the QR code is not valid. In this case:
    -Â  Check if the visitor has used a screenshot instead of the QR code directly from the app. Scanning a screenshot will lead to a red screen.
    - Ask the visitor to restart the app. And try again.
