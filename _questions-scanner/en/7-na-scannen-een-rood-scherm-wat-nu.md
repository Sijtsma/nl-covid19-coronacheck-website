A red screen means the visitor's QR code is not valid. This does not mean the visitor has tested positive for corona. It simply means the scanned QR code is not valid. This means they have either shared a screenshot or don't have a recent negative test declaration in their app. Without a valid test declaration, access is not permitted.
