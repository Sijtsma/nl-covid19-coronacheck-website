From June 5, visitors will need a negative test result to enter certain locations and activities. Thanks to the CoronaCheck app, visitors can access these locations. But only if a corona test shows that they did not have corona at the time.

CoronaCheck Scanner allows the inspector at the entrance to check the validity of the visitor's test certificate.
