title: When are the apps ready to be used? 
---
CoronaCheck and the CoronaCheck Scanner are currently being tested during the pilots ‘Testen voor Toegang’. These trials prove if the apps are working properly and show how they can be improved. For an overview of the pilot events, see the <a href='https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/algemene-coronaregels/cijfers-en-onderzoeken-over-het-coronavirus/pilot-toegangsbewijzen' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>website of the Dutch Government (Dutch)</a>.  
 
The apps will only be taken into use when their use has been approved by law. This legislation is necessary as a test declaration indirectly requires a visitor to be tested. When the apps are ready to be taken into use depends on when this legislation is implemented.
