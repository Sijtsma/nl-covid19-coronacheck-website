title: Why is the government developing the CoronaCheck Scanner?
---
The Dutch government wants to open social, cultural and sports locations in a responsible manner in times of corona. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors access to these locations, though only if a corona test shows they did not have corona at the time of testing.
 
With the CoronaCheck Scanner, the scanner checks the validity of the visitorâ€™s test declaration at the entrance.
